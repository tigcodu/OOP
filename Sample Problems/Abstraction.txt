EXECISE 4: ABSTRACTION 

CONCEPT: Abstraction (Abstract Classes and Methods) 

OBJECTIVE: Apply abstraction by defining an abstract class with abstract and concrete  methods. 

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: 
Create an abstract class called Employee with abstract methods calculateSalary() and 
 displayInfo(), and a concrete method companyPolicy() that prints a generic message. Then, 
  create subclasses FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee that extend Employee. Each 
   subclass should have its own attributes (like dailyRate, daysWorked, or hoursWorked, hourlyRate)
    and implement the abstract methods according to their salary computation.
