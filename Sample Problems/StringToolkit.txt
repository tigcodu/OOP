MACHINE PROBLEM 1: String Manipulation Toolkit
Machine Problem Overview:
Create a Java program that serves as a toolkit for string manipulation. The toolkit should
include a set of functions that perform various operations on strings. Each method should
focus on a specific aspect of string manipulation, utilizing relevant Java string methods.
String Toolkit Functions:
1. String Reversal: Implement a method that reverses a given string.
2. Palindrome Checker: Implement a method that checks whether a given string is a
palindrome.
3. Anagram Checker: Implement a function that checks if two strings are anagrams.
4. Word Count: Implement a function that counts the number of words in a given
string.
5. Character Count: Implement a method that counts the total number of characters
in the text (excluding spaces).
6. Substring Finder: Implement a method that finds all occurrences of a specified
substring in a given string.
7. Lower Case Converter: Implement a method that converts a given string to
lowercase.
8. Upper Case Converter: Implement a method that converts a given string to
uppercase.
9. Vowel Remover: Implement a method that removes all vowels from a given string.
10. Consonant Remover: Implement a function that removes all consonant from a
given string.
Note:
• Provide a clear input and output.
• Encourage the use of modular programming with well-defined methods for each
operation.
• Prompt users for input and display the results in a readable format.
• Include a comprehensive set of test cases to ensure the correctness of each
function.
