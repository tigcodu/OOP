EXERCISE 2: INHERITANCE 

CONCEPT: Inheritance (Parent-Child Class Relationship) 

OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate inheritance by extending functionality from a base class to a derived class. 

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: 
Design a base class called Vehicle with attributes brand, model, and year, and a method 
 displayDetails(). Then, create two subclasses: Car and Motorcycle. Each subclass should add 
  specific attributes (e.g., numberOfDoors for Car and engineType for Motorcycle) and override 
   the displayDetails() method to include their unique details. In your main() method, create 
    objects of both Car and Motorcycle, call their displayDetails(), and show how inheritance 
     allows reuse and extension of functionality.
