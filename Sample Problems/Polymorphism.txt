EXECISE 3: POLYMORPHISM 

CONCEPT: Polymorphism (Method Overriding and Dynamic Binding) 

OBJECTIVE: Implement polymorphism by defining a superclass and multiple subclasses that 
 override a common method. 

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION 
Create a superclass called Shape with a method calculateArea(). Then, create subclasses 
 Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle, each implementing calculateArea() differently. In the 
  main() method, create an array of Shape objects and assign one object of each subclass. 
   Use a loop to  display the area of each shape dynamically using the overridden methods. 

SAMPLE INPUT AND OUTPUT 

Enter shape type: Circle 
Enter radius: 5 
Area of Circle: 78.54 

Enter shape type: Rectangle 
Enter width: 4 
Enter height: 6 
Area of Rectangle: 24 

Enter shape type: Triangle 
Enter base: 8 
Enter height: 5 
Area of Triangle: 20
