EXERCISE 1: ENCAPSULATION 

CONCEPT: Encapsulation (Data Hiding and Access Control) 

OBJECIVE: Apply the concept of encapsulation by defining private attributes and controlling 
 access using public getter and setter methods. 

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION 
Create a Java class called BankAccount that models a simple banking system. The class 
 should contain three private attributes: accountNumber, accountHolder, and balance. Provide 
  public getter and setter methods for each attribute, ensuring that negative balances cannot be  set. 
Add two public methods: deposit(double amount) and withdraw(double amount). The 
 deposit() method should add money to the account only if the amount is positive, while the 
  withdraw() method should subtract money only if there are sufficient funds available. Include a 
   method displayAccountInfo() that prints all account details such as the account holder’s name, 
    account number, and current balance. 
In your main() method, create a BankAccount object, assign initial values using setters, and 
 simulate several transactions (both valid and invalid). Use printed statements to display what 
  happens after each operation to demonstrate how encapsulation protects and validates the  data.
